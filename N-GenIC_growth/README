This is the N-GenIC code used to generate the N-body initial conditions.
The codes uses the Zel'dovich approximation to generate the IC.
The code can create the ICs for pure CDM simulations, simulations containing
CDM & Baryons, CDM & neutrinos and CDM Baryons & neutrinos.

To compile the code the flags

-DMULTICOMPONENTGLASSFILE
-DDIFFERENT_TRANSFER_FUNC
-DNEUTRINOS

have to be switched on, even for pure CDM simulations.

For simulations with no baryons, set OmegaBaryon to 0 in the N-GenIC parameter 
file.

We have modified the files:

-allvars.h
-allvars.c
-read_param.c
-main.c

to allow the user whether or not Rayleigh sample the modes amplitude.


The code is able to deal with k-dependent growth factors, as those present in 
massive neutrino cosmologies. In the parameterfile the file containing the 
growth = dlog(delta) / dlog(a) is set with the parameter FileWithGrowth. That
file should be computed previously from two close power spectra from CAMB.

The value of H(z_initial) should also be input in the parameter file under 
the parameter.

The value of sigma8 in the parameterfile is just a sanity check if the
parameter ReNormalizeInputSpectrum is set to 0.
