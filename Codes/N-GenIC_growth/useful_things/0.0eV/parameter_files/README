This folder contains the files needed to generate the ICs of a 
massless neutrino cosmology. Notice that this kind of ICs should be used 
when other models with massive neutrinos are used as well. If no models with
massive neutrinos are used it is better to just use the 2LPT code by 
Scoccimarro.

In order to generate the ICs for the simulation you need to edit the file 
reps_0.0eV.param according to your cosmology and location of CAMB. Once the 
file is ready run reps with it: https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps

The code will produce the matter power spectra, transfer functions and growth
rate functions that N-GenIC_growth needs. The code will also produce a tabulated
H(z) function needed to run Gadget. The file file_format_Hz.py is used to change
the format of that file in order to be input into Gadget.

Finally, edit the file N-GenIC.param according to the parameters of your 
simulation and run it to generate the ICs.

If your cosmological model is Planck and your starting redshift is z=99 you can
use directly N-GenIC with the files already produced in the previous folder.
